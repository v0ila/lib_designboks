# Contributing

## Workflow

The source of opentype.js is divided into modules, located in the `src` directory. They are compiled into one file using [browserify](http://browserify.org/). The updated, compiled `opentype.js` and minified `opentype.min.js` are included with every commit. This makes it easy for library users to just grab the latest release. 

My workflow, on a new machine:

1. Clone the repository:

    git clone git://github.com/nodebox/opentype.js.git

2. Install the development dependencies (browserify, watchify and uglify-js):

    cd opentype.js
    npm install

3. Start the development server. This watches file changes and compiles and serves the page at http://localhost:8080/

    npm start
    
4. Make some changes. When you're done, compile the production opentype.js and opentype.min.js using make:

    make clean && make
    
5. Commit your changes

    git add --all && git commit


## How to Submit a Pull Request

1. Click the "Fork" button to create your personal fork of the opentype.js repository.
2. In the terminal, run `npm install` to install the dependencies needed for development.
3. Create a new branch for your feature. For example: `git checkout -b my-awesome-feature`. A dedicated branch for your pull request means you can develop multiple features at the same time, and ensures that your pull request is stable even if you later decide to develop an unrelated feature.
4. The `opentype.js` and `opentype.min.js` files are built from source files in the `src` directory. _Do not edit `opentype.js` directly._ Instead, edit the source files, and then run `make clean && make` to build the generated files.
5. Use `make test` to run tests and verify your changes.
7. Submit your pull request -- and thanks in advance!
